A Sudoku game built with React and TypeScript to demonstrate my ability as a front end developer.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in the following:

- How to build a Complete ReactJS Application
- Structuring Code and Implementing Best Practices
- TypeScript with ReactJS & Redux
- React Hooks
- Styled Components
- Offline & Mobile First Development Approach
- Unit Testing Functions with Jest
